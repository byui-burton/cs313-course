        <h1>Milestone Three</h1>
        <p>Complete and report on Milestone 3.</p>

        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <p>For this week's assignment, please download, fill out, and submit to I-Learn the <a href="313-milestone-report-form.txt" target="_BLANK">Milestone Report Form</a> to give an update on your progress.</p>

        <h3>A few comments:</h3>
        <p>It is not necessarily bad if you have to change your milestones as you get deeper into your projects, but each week you should be showing evidence of good progress toward your project completion.</p>

        <p>I also recognize it is not always possible for you to submit evidence for a milestone, but try to include something where possible.</p>
