        <h1>DB SET UP</h1>
        <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
        <p>Create the database for your PHP Project.</p>
        <h4>GUIDELINES</h4>
        <p>For this assignment, you need to have the schema in place for your database (e.g., create the tables and the relationships between them). You are not required to have the tables populated with data just yet (although, depending on your application, it might be a good idea to get some of this in place sooner than later).</p>
        <p>Please consider the following guidelines regarding this assignment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a MySQL database on your server.</li>
            <li>Create the tables you will need for your project.</li>
            <li>Choose appropriate data types for each column.</li>
            <li>Ensure that each table has an appropriate primary key.</li>
            <li>Include foreign key constraints wherever possible.</li>
            <li>Eliminate data redundancy wherever possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Demonstrate your database design by showing the tables, describing each one, and then showing the create statements necessary to create each. To do so, run the following commands in MySQL and then copy and paste the results into a text document to submit to I-Learn.</p>
        <p>SHOW TABLES</p>
        <p><b>Then for each table:</b></p>
        <p>DESCRIBE your-table-name;</p>
        <p>SHOW CREATE TABLE your-table-name;</p>
        <p>where &ldquo;your-table-name&rdquo; is the name of the table.</p>
