        <h1>PHP Database Access</h1>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>Your assignment this week is to complete read-only access to your database from your web application.</p>
        <p>This means that you should have at least some test data in your database, and then have PHP pages in place to query for that data and render it to the user. At this point, you are not required to have functionality to create or update data from your web pages (that is for next week).</p>
        <p>For most of you, this will require creating some forms that allow for querying/browsing your data, and displaying results (not simply having a page that dumps the whole database to the screen). This will likely also require creating and working with sessions to enable the current user's experience.</p>
        <p>In other words, at this point you should have the complete UI "framework" in place for your pages, with all the navigation links required, and the application should be functional from the perspective of clicking, browsing, and searching. Next week, you will be adding the functionality of adding and updating data.</p>
        <p>The styling may not be perfect at this point, but it should be in-process, and the general layout of the pages should be in place.</p>
        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
        <p>Please submit to I-Learn a brief list of the data that is displayed with links to the site/pages as appropriate, and if necessary, any instructions to see the data. This description need not be long, but rather a simple numbered list containing a single sentence and a link will likely suffice.</p>
        <p>Also, please make sure your latest code is pushed to GitHub!</p>

        <p>For this submission, download the <a href="313-submission-form.pdf" target="_BLANK">CS 313 Submission Form PDF</a>, include the information described above information, and submit it to I-Learn.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>As an example, please consider the following:</p>
        <p>Project Title: Chiropractic Patient And Symptom Tracker</p>
        <p>1. Patient list: A list of all patients in the system, each one is a link that leads to a patient details page. [link here...]</p>
        <p>2. Patient search: A simple form that allows for a last name to be entered, then the patient list will be shown for all patients that match the last name. [link here...]</p>
        <p>3. Patient details: A view of a single patient, showing their contact information, previous chiropractic experience, symptoms, etc. [link here...]</p>
        <p>4. The new patient form: This will be submitted and handled in the next assignment, but for this week, checkboxes are dynamically created based upon what is in the database. [link here...]</p>
