        <h1>Hello Openshift World</h1>
        <p>Your first assignment is to set up the infrastructure we will use for the rest of the semester. This includes setting up an account with RedHat OpenShift and GitHub, installing Git on your local machine, and publishing a simple "Hello World" HTML page. We will build out this web page and use this platform for the rest of the semester.</p>
        <p>Please note that while you may have other hosting set up from previous classes or experiences, it may not be sufficient for the requirements of this class, especially for the Java development we will be doing at the end of the semester. For this reason, please use OpenShift. It is free and will enable us all to be using the same technology so we can help each other troubleshoot any problems that may arise.</p>
        <p>Complete the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Install Git: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>

                <li>Create an account at OpenShift, configure your computer to deploy to it, and push a Hello World page to it. See this link: <a href="../prepare/313-01-prepare_openshift.html">Setting Up OpenShift</a></li>

                <li>Create a new repository at GitHub to share your code with the rest of us, and push your content to it. See this link: <a href="../prepare/313-01-prepare_github.html">Setting Up GitHub</a></li>

                <li>Post a link to your webpage and GitHub repo in two places. First, on the course wiki and second, submit a plain text document to I-Learn with the following information:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name: </li>
                    <li>Web application URL: (The link to your Hello World page at OpenShift)</li>
                    <li>Source control URL: (The link to your repository at GitHub)</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>This assignment is pass/fail.</p>
