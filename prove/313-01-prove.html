        <h1>Hello Openshift World</h1>
        <p><span>Your first assignment is to set up the infrastructure we will use for the rest of the semester. This includes setting up an account with RedHat OpenShift and GitHub, installing Git on your local machine, and publishing a simple "Hello World" HTML page. We will build out this web page and use this platform for the rest of the semester.</span></p>
        <p>Please note that while you may have other hosting set up from previous classes or experiences, it may not be sufficient for the requirements of this class, especially for the Java development we will be doing at the end of the semester. For this reason, please use OpenShift. It is free and will enable us all to be using the same technology so we can help each other troubleshoot any problems that may arise.</p>
        <p>Complete the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <ol>
                <li>Install Git: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
                <li><span>Create a new repository at GitHub and upload a simple HelloWorld page. See this link:</span><a href="../prepare/313-01-prepare_github.html">Setting Up GitHub</a>
                    <a></a>
                </li>
                <li><span>Setup OpenShift and push your page to it. See this link:</span><a href="../prepare/313-01-prepare_openshift.html">Setting Up OpenShift</a>
                    <a></a>
                </li>
                <li>Post a link to your webpage and GitHub repo in two places. First, on the course wiki and second, submit a link to the text area of this assignment in I-Learn.</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <p>This assignment is pass/fail.</p>
