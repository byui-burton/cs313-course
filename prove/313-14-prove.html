        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p><span>Please complete this self-assessment of your team project.</span>
            <br />
            <br /><span>Note that I-Learn will give you a "score" for each item after you submit it, but this is not counted as your score for the final project. Rather, the instructor will use this as they evaluate the project holistically.</span></p>
        <p>To begin, click the <b>Start</b> button in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can only take this quiz once. It must be taken in one session, you cannot leave and then come back to it.</p>
