        <h1>Submit Your Assignment</h1>
        <p>After creating a Hello World page and pushing it to both OpenShift and GitHub, submit this assignment by doing the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Make sure your latest code is pushed to GitHub.</li>
                <li>In I-Learn, navigate to the "Wiki Google Doc." in the "Resources" folder. We will use this Google Doc as a course wiki throughout the semester to post links to our work and any other helpful tips.</li>

                <li>Self-alphabetize this list by last name, and include the following:
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Web application URL (The link to your Hello World page at OpenShift)</li>
                    <li>Source control URL (The link to your repository at GitHub)</li>
                </ul>                
                <li>Download the <a href="./313-submission-form.txt" target="_BLANK">CS 313 Submission Form text file</a>.</li>
                <li>Fill out this form.</li>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>For the project title, put "Hello World".</li>
                    <li>Make sure the URL for your web application points to your OpenShift server, and shows your Hello World page in a browser.</li>
                    <li>Make sure your source code repository URL points to your GitHub page.</li>
                    <li>Sections like "any special instructions" won't be very important this week, but will be in future submissions.</li>
                    <li>Because this first assignment is pass/fail, for the category that best describes your assignment, select "Meets requirements" and then no justification is needed.</li>
                    <li>Save your changes to the PDF</li>
                </ul>

                <li>Upload this PDF to the I-Learn Dropbox for this assignment.</li>
