        <h1>PHP PROJECT PROPOSAL</h1>
        <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
        <p>For the first half of the semester, we will be working on individual projects with a portion of the assignment due each week.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to further develop students&rsquo; understanding of server-side web development concepts and to learn and apply good practice in database design/interaction.</p>
        <p>The guidelines in this document should be considered a minimum standard for what is expected, but as always you are encouraged to go above and beyond to learn as much as you can.</p>
        <h4>PROJECT GUIDELINES</h4>
        <p>Design and implement a simple web application with PHP/MySQL on the back-end. This project should allow you to demonstrate proficiency in the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client-side development principles (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)</li>
            <li>Basic PHP development</li>
            <li>Session handling in PHP</li>
            <li>Database design concepts, including foreign key relationships</li>
            <li>Database setup and queries in MySQL</li>
            <li>Database retrieval in PHP</li>
            <li>Database modification from PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You may propose whatever project you like as long as it allows you to demonstrate these skills.</p>
        <h4>PROPOSAL GUIDELINES</h4>
        <p>For your proposal document, please create an executive summary of what you propose for your project. It need not be long (two pages at the most), but it should look professional, communicate the project to be solved, and it should meet the above guidelines. Specifically, please organize your document into the following sections (each one being roughly 1-2 paragraphs):</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Project description.</b> Briefly describe the project&mdash;what it will do, who the audience will be, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Design overview</b>. Briefly describe <i>how</i> your program will go about solving the problem from the first section. This should be a high level description, but should communicate the general approach that you will take.</li>
            <li><b>Database</b>. The first weekly assignment will be to implement your database. Please briefly describe the kind of data that will be stored in your database, including relationships between the entities. For each entity, list the name and any columns/properties it will have. You should have at least three or four entities with some level of relationships among them.</li>
            <li><b>Database Retrieval</b>. The second weekly assignment will be to retrieve data from your database and display it to the user. Please briefly describe what data you will retrieve and how it will be presented.</li>
            <li><b>Database Update</b>. The third weekly assignment will be to insert and update data in your database. Please briefly describe what data the user will be able to add/update, how they will do it, and what considerations will be in place to ensure the integrity of the data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You may consider including illustrations/figures/mockups in any of the above sections if they help communicate more clearly.</p>
        <p>Feel free to include additional sections as you see fit, but remember this is designed to be an executive summary, not an exhaustive design document.</p>
        <p>Please save the document as a PDF and submit it to I-Learn.</p>
