        <h1>Milestone One</h1>
        <p>Complete and report on Milestone 1.</p>
        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>For this week's assignment, please give a status report by creating a text document that includes the following:</p>
        <p>1. List the members of your group and the title of your project.</p>
        <p>2. List what your Milestone was (e.g. from your proposal).</p>
        <p>3. Describe what you have done this week, and how it meets, falls short of, or is different than your milestone, and why.</p>
        <p>4. Give a link to your application, and describe what I can do to see evidence of your milestone (if possible).</p>
        <p>5. List plans for next week (and note if they are different than your original milestone plans for next week).</p>
        <p>6. Submit your status report to I-Learn.</p>
        <p>A few comments:</p>
        <p>It is not necessarily bad if you have to change your milestones as you get deeper into your projects, but each week you should be showing evidence of good progress toward your project completion.</p>
        <p>I also recognize it is not always possible for you to submit evidence for a milestone, but try to include something where possible.</p>
