        <h1>Cs 313 App Store</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In addition to putting the finishing touches on your project, your assignment for this week is to create a page for our class app store to promote and introduce your group project. You peers will use this page to learn about and evaluate your project as part of the final, so it should be professional, well-designed, and highlight what you have done.</p>

        <h2>Guidelines</h2>
        <p>This page is being done in lieu of a formal class presentation, so an equivalent level of effort should be exerted.</p>

        <p>Specifically consider the following guidelines:</p>
        <p>It should be a single page, and should not require going through multiple links or have excessive scrolling (it is intended to be similar to something you might see in an app store). Having carousels or a few tabs with small amounts of information is fine.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>This page should get someone excited about using your application. Help them see the motivation, and how it will fill a need in their life, in addition to promoting what it does.</li>
            <li>You will likely want to include screenshots or other graphics to highlight functionality.</li>
            <li>Please be accurate about what your application actually does. Future plans and enhancements should be listed as "coming soon" or "future enhancements," etc.</li>
            <li>Have a link to your actual website so that after reading your page, someone else can quickly dive into your app and have it change their life.</li>
            <li>If using your app requires a small tutorial, consider having that as a separate page on your application, labeled "Getting Started" or something similar. This tutorial may be the page you want to link to from your app store page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Add a link to your page to the "CS 313 App Store" section of the course wiki.</p>
        <p>Make sure that everything is in place and ready to be viewed by 11:59 PM Saturday evening, so that I (and each of you) can go through them beginning at that point.</p>
        <p>Submit a link to your App Store page for this assessment in I-Learn.</p>
