    <h1>Deploying Content to Openshift</h1>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to deploy content to OpenShift is to use Git. These steps will walk you through setting up Git and using it to deploy to your server. </p>

        <p>In this course we assume you already have basic experience with Git from your earlier courses. If you do not, you will still be ok, but you will need to come up to speed on your own. Here is some helpful information:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE" target="_blank">An introductory tutorial on YouTube</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics" target="_blank">The official documentation</a> - (It's actually well-written and relatively easy to follow!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <p>The following steps will help walk you through setting up Git on your computer and using it to connect to OpenShift and deploy a Hello World page. Later we will also use get to push our source code to a public source control server (GitHub). This can be a little bit confusing at first because we will have three separate Git repositories:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>On your local computer</strong> - You have to commit changes here, before you can push them anywhere else.</li>
            <li><strong>At OpenShift</strong> - We push here to deploy our application.</li>
            <li><strong>At GitHub</strong> - We push here to share our code with our classmates and the instructor.</li>
        </ol>



        <h3>Install Git</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Download and install Git <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_BLANK">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Generate and upload SSH Keys</h3>
            <p>SSH keys are a way to let you securely log in to a server. You use them by generating a pair of keys, one that is public and one that is private. You keep one of them on your computer and upload the other to your server. Then, by putting these keys together you can be securely authenticated.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/" target="_BLANK">This tutorial</a> (from GitHub's documentation) walks you through the process of generating a public/private SSH key pair. You should follow this tutorial, <strong>except</strong> in Step 4, when it has you upload your key to GitHub, you should instead upload your key to OpenShift.</li>

                <li>Sign into the OpenShift web console, and click the settings tab.</li>

                <li>Under the Public Keys section, click to add a new key.</li>

                <li>Give you key a name, then paste in the contents of your public key.</li>

                <div class="tips">For a public key name, you usually want to pick  something that tells you what computer your logging in from, such as: "sb_laptop".</div>
            </ol>

        <h3>Clone your repository</h3>
        <p>When you created your application at OpenShift, it started a Git repository there with the initial files for your PHP application. You should now "clone" it to your local computer, then you can change the local copy, commit it and push it back up.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In the OpenShift Web Console, click the applications tab, then click on the name of your application. Then on the right side of the page, it should have the URL of your repository. Something like:
<div class="code">
ssh://xxxxxxx@php-sburton.rhcloud.com/~/git/php.git
</div>          
                </li> 
                <li>On your computer, create a directory on your computer for your CS 313 work.</li>
                <li>In a terminal window (GitBash on Windows), navigate to that directory.</li>

                <div class="tips">When you install Git on your computer, for Windows users, it will also install "GitBash" which is a command prompt or terminal. It is similar to the Windows command prompt, except that it gives you access to the Git program as well as several helpful unix-style commands. I find these very helpful, and use GitBash almost exclusively, as opposed to the Windows command prompt.</div>

                <li>Clone the repository, using something like the following: (and copying and pasting your Git URL from the application page).

<div class="code">
git clone ssh://xxxxxxx@php-sburton.rhcloud.com/~/git/php.git
</div>
                This will create a sub-directory with the same name as your application (e.g., php.git).</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Deploying content to your site</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>In your terminal window, change into the newly created sub-directory (e.g. php).</li>
                <li>Notice there is an index.php page currently present. Remove this page.</li>
                <li>Create your own index.html page (using any editor of your choice) that displays the text Hello World.</li>

                <li>In your terminal window, type "git status" to show the changes have been made. In this case, it should show that have you deleted the index.php page, and create a new index.html page (that is currently not-tracked).</li>

                <li>Add your index.html page to be tracked by Git (<code>git add index.html</code>).</li>
                <li>Commit your changes to your local Git repository (<code>git commit -m "Adding my hello world page"</code>)</li>

                <div class="tips">If you forget to include a message, Git will set you to its default text editor to create one. This might be VIM, which you may or may not be familiar with. If it is and you "just want to get out of it!" hit ESC, the type ":q!" to quit without saving changes. You will not have added a message, so your commit will not have gone through, but at least you have gotten out alive! :-).</div>

                <li>Now, your changes are in your local Git repository, but we still need to push them to OpenShift. Do this by "pushing" them with the command "git push origin master". (The GitHub repository is your "origin" remote by default.)</li>
                
                <li>When you push code to OpenShift, it automatically kicks off a build that will do any actions necessary to deploy your site. You will set an output of these actions in your terminal window, hopefully resulting in a "success" message.</li>

                <li>Verify that your new hello world page is up. It should be out at your main URL such as: http://php-sburton.rhcloud.com/ (of course with your application name and username). If you have forgotten your URL, you can find it on the Applications page of the OpenShift web console.</li>

                <li>Celebrate. You have just pushed your first content to your site! Throughout the semester you will repeat this process many times. Put new content into this directory, "git add", "git commit" and "git push".</li>

                <div class="tips">You are more than welcome to use any GUI tools for Git that you would like. I find them to be helpful when everything is going well, but when something weird happens, going to the terminal window and running a "git status" command usually helps me track down problems better than anything else.</div>

            </ol>
