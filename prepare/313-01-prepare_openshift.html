    <h1>Setting Up Openshift</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>The following steps will help walk you through setting up an initial PHP application at OpenShift and deploying a "Hello World" page to it using Git.</p>

        <h3>Create a new PHP application at OpenShift</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Create new account at OpenShift.com. Fill in your information and respond to the confirmation email.</li>

                <li>Log in (Click My Account -> Openshift Web Console), go to the applications section, and click the link to create your first application.</li>
                
                <li>Select "PHP 5.4" (not any other servers or frameworks with it, just PHP 5.4)</li>

                <li>On the configuration page, you will need to choose a name for this application and then a namespace. The namespace will be shared by all your OpenShift applications and the application name is just for this one. For example, I chose "sburton" as my namespace, and "php" for my application, so it is named, "php-sburton.rhcloud.com"</li>
                
                <li>Select a "small gear" and "No scaling". (If you don't you will not be able to complete some steps in future assignments.)</li>
                    
                <li>Click Create application. When it finishes, click "Continue to the application overview page."</li>
                
                <div class="tips">Sometimes for me, this takes several minutes, and once in a while, it never gives me a confirmation page! Yet, after a few minutes, if I go to the applications page, it seems to be created ok.</div>
            </ol>
        <h3>Verify your configuration</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Verify that your site is up by opening your URL in a new tab. It should be something like:</p>
                    <p><a href="http://php-sburton.rhcloud.com">http://php-sburton.rhcloud.com</a> (of course substituting your own domain)</p>
                    <p>When you go to this page, you should see: "Welcome to your PHP application on OpenShift" with a lot of other content about how to get set up.</p>
                </li>

            </ol>
