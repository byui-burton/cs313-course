        <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
        <p>The new material this week is fairly minimal because we are focused on wrapping up and cementing the concepts we have been using all semester. There are, however, a few topics to consider:</p><b>Authentication:</b>&nbsp;The goal here is not to become a security expert, but to at least be aware of some of the common vulnerabilities and techniques.
        <ul>
            <li>Perhaps the best way to handle authentication on your PHP site is to use an external library/service to handle it. There are many intricacies associated with security, so entrusting these issues to someone who has gone through the details rather than reinventing the wheel can be a really good idea. One such approach is to use <a href="http://openid.net/get-an-openid/what-is-openid/" target="_blank">OpenID. </a></li>
            <li>If, however, you are going to store usernames and passwords in your application, it is critical (and easy!) to at least hash the passwords rather than storing them directly. See <a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/#password_hashing" target="_blank">Password Hashing </a> &nbsp;and <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/faq.passwords.php" target="_blank">Safe Password Hashing. </a></li>
            <li>Also consider these <a href="http://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/09/04/some-best-practices-for-web-app-authentication/" target="_blank">Best Practices for Web App Authentication. </a></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>AJAX and PHP:</b>&nbsp;For the most part, AJAX should be a review from previous classes in client side development.</p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>Using a client side library.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While AJAX can be done using basic JavaScript, many well-established libraries exist that can make the job much easier. In industry it is very standard to use these libraries for client side interaction.</li>
                    <li><a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery </a> &nbsp;is one good option to consider as a lightweight and easy to use library (there are obviously many others as well).</li>
                </ul>
                <li>JSON</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>While your PHP page can return any data back for your JavaScript to parse, it is often helpful to return JSON. PHP has a built-in function to encode variables/arrays in JSON format:&nbsp;<a href="http://us3.php.net/json_encode" target="_blank">json_encode. </a></li>
                    <li>If you are returning JSON, you should set the MIME type to match. Putting this at the top of your PHP page will do the trick:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>header(&lsquo;Content-type: application/json&rsquo;);</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <li>A simple example of sending back data in JSON format from PHP</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.caveofprogramming.com/frontpage/articles/php/php-json-an-example-javascript-json-client-with-php-server/" target="_blank">Cave of Programming example</a></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <ul>
                <ul>

                </ul>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Best practices in PHP:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <ul>
                <li>This week, when posting to the developer forum, please try to identify a best practice suggestion for some component of PHP/MySQL development.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
