    <h1>Setting Up Heroku</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>The following steps will help walk you through setting up an initial PHP application at Heroku and deploying a "Hello World" page to it using Git.</p>

        <h3>Install Required Tools</h3>
            <p>There are a few necessary tools for the setup process.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download and install Git <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_BLANK">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a></li>

                <div class="tips">When you install Git on your computer, for Windows users, it will also install "GitBash" which is a command prompt or terminal. It is similar to the Windows command prompt, except that it gives you access to the Git program as well as several helpful unix-style commands. I find these very helpful, and use GitBash almost exclusively, as opposed to the Windows command prompt.</div>

                <li>Download and install WAMP / MAMP / XAMP (or just plain PHP?)</li>
                <li>Download and install <a href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md" target="_BLANK">Composer</a>, a package manager for PHP.
                    <div class="tips">On the composer install page, look for the section for your operating system. For Windows users, this will have you download and run a straightforward installer. For Mac users got to the section "Installation - Linux / Unix / OSX" and follow the steps for "Globally". This amounts to copying and pasting some commands into your terminal window.</div>
                </li>

            </ol>

        <h3>Create a new Heroku PHP application</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Go to Heroku.com and click "Sign up" for a free account. Fill in your information and respond to the confirmation email. This should have you create a password and finish the account creation process.</p></li>


                <li>From the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#introduction" target="_BLANK">Getting Started with PHP</a> tutorial and Heroku, go through each of the following steps:</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction</li>
                    <li>Set up</li>
                    <li>Prepare the App</li>
                    <li>Deploy the App</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="tips">The additional steps of the tutorial are not required to get your first application up and running but explain some of the nice features available at Heroku.</div>
            </ol>
        

                <!-- <li><p>Download the Heroku CLI tool from the set-up page of <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-php#set-up" target="_BLANK">Heroku tutorial</a>. (Select your operating system in the box, and then click it to download the tool.</p></li> -->
              
<!--                  <li><p>In a terminal window (or git bash on windows), run the command, "heroku login". This will prompt for your Heroku username and password.</p></li>
 -->
