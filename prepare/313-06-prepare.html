        <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
        <p>To prepare for the week, please read/watch the following resources before meeting with your group. Please consider the links here as a starting point. As you find other good references, please post them to the wiki.</p>
        <h4>Basic query information</h4>
        <p>We have touched on many of these queries in past weeks. The following links are from W3Schools, and give a good basic overview of the syntax of the query.</p>
        <p>Please note the importance of the WHERE clause on the update and delete queries. <b>Without it, you will update or delete every row in the table!</b> It is often helpful to run the exact query you plan to use for a delete as a &ldquo;SELECT * FROM&hellip;&rdquo; type of query first, to see the rows that will be affected, and then change the &ldquo;SELECT *&rdquo; to &ldquo;DELETE,&rdquo; etc.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_insert.asp" target="_blank">Insert</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_update.asp" target="_blank">Update</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_delete.asp" target="_blank">Delete</a></li>
            <li>In addition, depending on your projects, you may have need for other advanced queries, or functions (e.g., average, max, min). <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp" target="_blank">The W3Schools page</a>&nbsp;is a decent resource to list these options and give you the basics to get you started, but you may need to seek out further information for whichever topic you need.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Connecting from PHP</h4>
        <p>Running these queries from PHP is no different than connecting and running a Select query as we have done previously.</p>
        <p>One point that is worth noting: after inserting a row into a table where an auto-generated ID is the primary key, it is often useful to get that new id, for future updates or inserts into other tables. The last inserted id is can be obtained using:</p>
        <p>If you are using mysqli:
            <br /><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">$newId = $mysqli-&gt;insert_id;</span></p>
        <p>If you are using PDO
            <br /><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">$newId = $pdo-&gt;lastInsertId();</span></p>
        <h4>Other Topics</h4>
        <p>In addition, make sure you are comfortable with the following topics that we have encountered to some degree over the past weeks. A basic link from W3Schools is provided, but further research may be required.</p>
