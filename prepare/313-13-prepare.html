        <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
        <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The preparation material this week is different than in weeks past.</span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>For this week, your assignment is to learn about a new web technology that we have not discussed in class (and that you have not used previously), and come prepared to discuss it.</span></p>
        <p dir="ltr"><span>Specifically, be prepared to talk about points such as the following:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What is the main purpose of this technology (what was it designed for)?</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What are some of its strengths and weaknesses compared to others that are designed for a similar purpose?</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What are some of its limitations and areas where it should not be applied?</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">How does it compare to or possibly integrate with some of the technologies we have discussed in this course?</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span><span></span><span>You need not prepare a formal presentation, and you shouldn&rsquo;t spend hours upon hours on this research, but it should be more than a quick 20 minute skim.</span></span>
