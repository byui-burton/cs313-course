        <h1>PREPARATION</h1>
        <p>To prepare you for your Week 1 Preparation Activity, please go through the following tutorial from W3Schools:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"></span><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/default.asp" target="_blank">PHP Basics (From &ldquo;PHP Intro&rdquo; to&nbsp;&ldquo;PHP Superglobals.&rdquo;)</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></p>
        <p><b></b><b>Set Up Local Environment</b></p>
        <p>You could do all of your development and testing right on your server, but this can be a little cumbersome, and you may want to debug your application a little more thoroughly before you make it available to the world. Thus, it is nice to have a development environment on your local machine, and then you can push your changes to the server when they are ready to deploy.</p>
        <p>For the first half of the semester, we will be using PHP and MySQL over an Apache web server. There are some nice (free) packages that will help you install and set up these tools on your laptop. It is recommended that you download and install one:</p>
        <p>Windows: WAMP - <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">http://www.wampserver.com/en/</a></p>
        <p>Mac: MAMP - <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">http://www.mamp.info/en/</a></p>
        <p>You may also consider XAMPP which installs on Linux, Mac, or Windows: <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" target="_blank">https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html</a></p>
        <p>While this is not required to create your home page (this week's assignment), it would be good to start playing around with PHP on your own computer, and you will need to have this in place for the team activity and assignment next week.</p>
