        <h1>CONSUMING WEB SERVICES</h1>
        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>As each of you are working at accessing a third party API, we will spend some time talking about that process this week. Because each of you will be working with different APIs, the specific process will be slightly different, however, there are some general principles we can work through together.</p>
        <h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
        <p>This week, we will be working in earnest on our group projects. One task that each of you will be working with to some degree or another, is to use web services or APIs, so that is what we will be studying this week.</p>
        <p>In particular, the preparation material will guide you through two aspects of connecting to APIs. First, we will look at REST web services in general, and how to get data from them, when no authentication is required. The team readiness activity will provide an opportunity to practice this.</p>
        <p>The second aspect we will briefly cover in the preparation, is the basics of connecting to an API using OAuth 2.0 authentication. This is what most of you will need to do for your group projects. An example is provided to show how to connect to the Facebook API, using the Facebook4j library. While the specifics may be different for each API, the concepts will be very similar.</p>
        <p>Finally, the weekly assignment is to complete the first milestone of your group project.</p>
