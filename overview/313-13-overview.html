        <h1>OTHER TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
        <p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></p>
        <p>One of the major objectives of this course is to be able to learn and evaluate new technologies. For this week&rsquo;s preparation, you are to choose a new technology that you haven&rsquo;t used before and go learn about it. See if you can identify strengths and limitations and how it compares to others that you know about. Then you will discuss your new technologies with your group.</p>
        <h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <p>Rather than having formal &ldquo;presentations&rdquo; for your group projects as we do in many courses, you will instead be expected to prepare an &ldquo;App Store&rdquo; style page to promote it to your peers and show off what you have done. Then next week, you will each go over each others&rsquo; applications and give comments and a rating. These app store pages and a link to your working application must be up by Saturday night, to be ready for everyone to evaluate them.</p>
        <p>Please note that there are ALMOST ALWAYS issues that arise when you deploy your application to your server and have someone besides the developer test it. Please plan accordingly and make sure to deploy and test your application early in the week so that you have time to find and fix any issues that come up.</p>
