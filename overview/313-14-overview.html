        <h1>CONCLUSION - REVIEW AND FINAL EXAM</h1>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>We have made it to the final week of the semester! At this point we have built some professional web applications in both PHP and Java, and have learned about principles and patterns of good web application design.</p>
        <h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
            <p>During this final week, each person needs to evaluate all of the other group projects, leaving feedback, and rating them to determine the best app of the class.</p>
            <p>Also, you need to take the final exam this week. As with the midterm, this exam will be much more focused on conceptual questions rather than syntax basics. The preparation section provides a list of topics that we have discussed, and that you should be comfortable discussing. At this point it would be difficult to &ldquo;cram&rdquo; for this exam, as these are concepts we have been developing all semester long.</p>
