            <p>Course Materials Needed</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Internet</li>
                <li>Web hosting at OpenShift. Free for basic usage.</li>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>This course builds upon Web Engineering I allowing students to create more advanced web applications and services. The emphasis of this course will be on server-side technologies and n-tier applications using relational database technology. Different server-side technologies will be used for creating dynamic n-tier web applications. Client side technologies will be enhanced and combined with server-side technologies to create rich; web applications.</p>
            <p>At the end of this semester successful students will be able to:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create advanced web applications and services through server side programming and relational database technology.</li>
                <li>Build rich, dynamic, n-tier web applications.</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the ability and recognize the importance of separating web applications into tiers.</li>
                <li>Recognize the fundamentals behind and understand the advantages and disadvantages of the many different and competing web technologies.</li>
                <li>Independently learn and apply new technologies.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
            <p>Prepare: You will be reading reference and tutorial websites and watching instructor demos.</p>
            <p>Teach One Another: You will be participating in Team Readiness Exercises, posting helpful links, and working on team projects.</p>
            <p>Ponder and Prove: You will be doing weekly programming assignments (both individual and team-based).</p>

            <h2>Activities And Assignments</h2>
            <h3>Team Readiness Activity Instructions</h3>
            <p>At the beginning of each week, there will be a Team Readiness Activity designed to help reinforce the concept that will be covered that week, and give students an opportunity to teach one another, and to be prepared for the weekly assignment.</p>
            
            <p>These activities are to be completed in teams (except for the first two weeks when we will have <em>Individual</em> Readiness Activities), and are designed to take less than an hour. Each activity is designed to be a straightforward application of the concepts of the week to help prepare students for the weekly assignment, which will require significantly more application, adaptation, and problem solving skills.</p>

            <p>Face-to-Face students will complete this activity in class during the first class meeting of the week.</p>

            <p>Online students need to coordinate a time to meet with their team members each week before Wednesday night when the assignment is due. At a minimum, online students should arrange a virtual meeting (Skype, Google Hangout, etc.), where they can verbally work together as the assignment is written. The assignment itself can be jointly co-authored in a real-time collaborative editor (Google Docs), or IT could be authored on a student's computer provided the screen is shared to allow the other team members to help describe what to type.</p>
            
            <p>Each student is expected to read/watch the weekly preparation material before meeting with their teams to make the meeting time as efficient as possible. Each team member is expected to contribute to this deliverable, and each will submit a copy of the same files.</p>

            <p>If circumstances require a student to be absent, they must notify the instructor and their teammates beforehand, in which case they will receive the same score as their teammates. Otherwise no credit will be given for the activity. In addition, at the end of the semester each individual will evaluate the contributions of their team members, which will also factor into the team activity score.</p>
            
            <h3>Assignments/Projects</h3>
            <p>An assignment/project and a self-assessment will be due each week on Saturday night. For much of the first half of the semester, students will work on an individual project, where the weekly assignments make up pieces of the overall project. For the second half of the semester, students will be divided into teams working on more in depth projects and will have weekly milestones to meet.</p>
            
            <h3>Exams</h3>
            <p>There will be one midterm exam and one comprehensive final exam.</p>

            <h3>Wiki and Developer Forum Discussion Board</h3>
            <p>Each week you should participate on either the Wiki or the Developer Forum discussion board by contributing at least one entry, post, or comment on another student's posting. You are encouraged to add helpful links to fixes you may have found, or anything interesting that is related to the course material. Feel free to visit with each other on the discussion boards and get to know your classmates. Ask each other questions if you are struggling with any concept, and help each other by providing answers to any questions you can.</p>

            <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
            <p>Grades will be assigned according to the following breakdown:</p>
            <p><strong>Assignments/Projects: 50%</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Team Activities: 15%</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Exams: 25%</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Preparation Quizzes: 10%</strong></p>
            <h3>Assessments</h3>
            <p>Grades for most assignments (unless otherwise noted) are assigned in broad terms according to the following scale:</p>
            <p><strong>50% - Some attempt was made</strong></p>
            <p><strong>70% - Developing, but significantly deficient</strong></p>
            <p><strong>85% - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate</strong></p>
            <p><strong>93% - Meets Requirements</strong></p>
            <p><strong>100% - Shows Creativity, and a desire to excel above and beyond</strong></p>

            <h2>Academic Honesty</h2>
            <p>Be responsible for your own education. You may work with your classmates, but all individual work that is submitted must be original. When programming, share ideas but do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant.</p>
            <p>I encourage you to use the Internet as a resource, but recognize that you should not copy and paste someone else's work as your own. Cite all sources and follow copyright laws. When in doubt, give credit and be upfront.</p>
            <p>The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: a zero on the assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the university.</p>

            <h2>Changes To Schedule And Assignments</h2>
            <p>Schedules, assignments, and policies are subject to change. You will be notified of any changes in class and on the course website.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Brigham Young University-Idaho is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. If you have a disability and require accommodations, please contact the Disability Services Office (208) 496-9210. Reasonable academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities.
