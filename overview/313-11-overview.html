        <h1>Java Database Access (JDBC)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This week will we be learning about database access in Java. In particular, will we be working with JDBC, which should appear similar in many ways to the database interaction we did in PHP. Next week, we will learn the basics of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) approach, which provides a slightly different form of database access by building another layer of abstraction on top of a more fundamental layer like we are learning this week.</p>
        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>As always, there will be preparation material and a team activity to start the week, but then the weekly assignment is simply to complete the next milestone of your Java project. Because of the different nature of your projects, this may require some of you to dive deeper into these database concepts than others depending on your specific project needs.</p>
        <p>Also, even though each of you are working on different topics or APIs, please don't forget to contribute to the course wiki regarding something you found. There are a lot of general principles that can help everyone in the class.</p>
