        <h1>Course Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to CS 313!</p>
        <p>During this introductory week you will become oriented with this online course, get to know classmates, and setup your web hosting account. After this week's activities you will be ready to jump into Web Engineering II.</p>
        <p>This week your assignment is to set up the infrastructure (server and source control repository) that you will be using for the rest of the semester. While these steps seem fairly straightforward, there are always issues that can arise that require troubleshooting. For this reason, you should start on these tasks early in the week to allow time to overcome any issues that arise.</p>
        <p>If you find any "gotchas" that you are able to overcome, please post your solutions/process to the course wiki. If you get stuck, please post questions to the course developer forum and keep an eye out for others' questions that you may be able to answer.</p>
