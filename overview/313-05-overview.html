            <h1>PHP Database Access</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The assignment for this week is to complete the read only access for your individual PHP projects. In most cases, this will require significantly more than just listing out the data in a table (as we will do for the Team Readiness Activity), but will also require creating forms to allow for searching/browsing. It will also require creating several PHP pages with links between them. This will likely be the busiest week so far this semester, so please get started early, so you can ask and answer questions.</p>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>In last week's lesson, we learned how to design and create simple databases in MySQL. This week, we will learn how to query that database as well as how to run these queries and display results on a PHP page. In that regard, we will focus primarily on read-only database access, and next week will focus on modifying the database (insert, update, and delete).</p>
