        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO SERVER SIDE PROGRAMMING</h1>
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>By Saturday, you need to complete your personal homepage and put a link to it on the Course website. Also by Saturday, you need complete a proposal for your PHP project. This project will guide much of your work for the next several weeks, as you work to put milestones in place. Choose a project that you are interested in and that will stretch you. Remember, the amount of learning and growth you achieve will be largely driven by how much you push yourself in these assignments.</p>
        <h4>OBJECTIVES</h4>
        <p>The objective of this lesson is to introduce basic PHP language concepts and highlight potential differences from other programming languages.</p>
