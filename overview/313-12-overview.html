        <h1>Object-relational Mapping (JPA)</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Last week, we learned about the basics of connecting to databases from Java. This week we will briefly introduce an abstraction to database interaction called Object/Relational Mapping (ORM). While we will be looking specifically at JPA (the Java Persistence API), you should be aware that approach is common in many languages and there are several libraries that perform the same task in slightly different ways.</p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>As with last week, there is preparation material and a weekly team readiness activity that reinforces the concepts of JPA. The weekly assignment for this week is again to complete the next milestone of your Java project, which may require some of you to dive deeper into this topic than others, depending on the specific needs of your project.</p>

        <p>As always, even though your Java projects may be taking you in slightly different directions, make sure to contribute to the class wiki and discussion boards according to what you are learning and finding.</p>

        <p>Don't forget that as part of this week's milestone you need to deploy your application to OpenShift and get at least basic functionality working there.</p>
