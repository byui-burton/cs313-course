        <h1>Spiritual Preparation</h1>

        <p>Before class this week, please watch / listen to (or read if you must): <a href="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/lord-is-it-i?lang=eng" target="_blank" title="Lord, Is it I?">Lord, Is it I?</a> by Dieter F. Uchtdorf.</p>
    	
    	<p>Please note that this address was given in the Priesthood session of conference, so he addresses the brethren in the audience specifically, but his message certainly applies to all of us.</p>
