        <h1>Spiritual Preparation</h1>

        <p>Before class this week, please listen to: <a href="https://byui-media.ldscdn.org/byui_ft/devo_audio/1976_09_07_ADV_Eyring.mp3" title="Writing Our Book of Life" target="_blank">Writing Our Book of Life</a> by Henry B. Erying. He gave this talk here (at Ricks College) in 1976 when he was president.</p>

        <p>Please note that there is no transcription for this, so you will have to listen to it. It is about 40 minutes long, so please plan accordingly.</p>
