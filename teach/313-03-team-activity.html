        <h1>TEAM READINESS ACTIVITY</h1>
        <h3>PREPARE</h3>
        <p>Before doing this activity, each student should read the weekly preparation material to ensure that the team meeting is as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
        <h3>TEACH ONE ANOTHER</h3>
        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS:</h4>
        <p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
        <p>Create an HTML file that contains a form composed of the following components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Name (text)</li>
            <li>Email (text)</li>
            <li>Major (radio button) with the following options:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Computer Science</li>
                <li>Web Development and Design</li>
                <li>Computer information Technology</li>
                <li>Computer Engineering</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Places you have visited (checkbox) with the following options:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>North America</li>
                <li>South America</li>
                <li>Europe</li>
                <li>Asia</li>
                <li>Australia</li>
                <li>Africa</li>
                <li>Antartica</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Comments (text area)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
        <p>You do not need to style this HTML form, but each input should be labeled and separated from each other.</p>
        <p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
        <p>Create a PHP script to handle this form, so that when the form is submitted, it captures the form data and produces a web page that displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the user's name.</li>
            <li>their email address, with a &ldquo;mailto:&rdquo; link for the email address.</li>
            <li>their major.</li>
            <li>a list of all the places they have visited.</li>
            <li>their comments</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 4:</b></p>
        <p>Again, this data need not be styled, but it should be labeled and separated from each other.</p>
        <p><b>Step 5:</b></p>
        <p>Use the POST method for your form submission.</p>
        <h4>PROVE</h4>
        <p>Each student should submit a copy of the assignment to I-Learn. Please submit both the HTML form and the PHP script that handles this form. Note that these should be identical, but it is important to make sure that each student on the team has a copy of the work.</p>
