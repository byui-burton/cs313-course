        <h1>Team Readiness Activity 5</h1>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>Before doing this activity, each student should read the weekly preparation material to ensure that the team meeting is as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
        <h2>Teach One Another</h2>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Your assignment is to create a simple database and query it to display results on a PHP page. For this assignment, you should work on the same database/PHP file, (rather than doing this separately), so you will want to use screen sharing or other collaborative programs to ensure everyone can be involved.</p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p><b>Step 1:</b>&nbsp;Create a new database table called "Scriptures" that has the following columns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>id</li>
            <li>book</li>
            <li>chapter</li>
            <li>verse</li>
            <li>content</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 2:</b>&nbsp;Insert the following scriptures (along with the text of the verse as content) into your database:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>John 1:5</li>
            <li>Doctrine and Covenants 88:49</li>
            <li>Doctrine and Covenants 93:28</li>
            <li>Mosiah 16:9</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Step 3:&nbsp;</b>Create a PHP page to query this database and list the scriptures. Put a heading at the top of the page to display "Scripture Resources". Then for each scripture, display the book chapter and verse in bold, followed by a hyphen and then the content of the scripture in quotes. For example:</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Scripture Resources</h3>
        <p><b>John 3:16</b> - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
        <p><b>Proverbs 3:5</b> - "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."</p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Prove</h2>
        <p>Each member of the team should submit a copy of the PHP file to I-Learn. You need not submit your database.</p>
        <p><span>As a stretch challenge, you may complete the following steps for extra credit:</span></p>
        <p><span><b>Stretch Challenge 1:</b> Create a PHP form to search for a book and display all the scriptures in your database that match that book.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span><b>Stretch Challenge 2:</b> Push this database and code to one of your servers and get it to work there.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span>Please indicate in your submission comments if you completed the basic task and which stretch challenges you completed.&nbsp;</span></p>
