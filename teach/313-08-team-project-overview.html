        <h1>Java Project Overview</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For the second half of the semester we will be building web applications using Java. As with our PHP project in the first half of the semester, this will be an extended project that will drive the assignments and much of our learning for the rest of the semester.</p>

        <h2>Basic Guidelines</h2>
        <p>One of the strengths of using Java and separating the application into tiers is the ability to handle more complicated logic, rules, and interaction of objects. To help facilitate an application with more complex objects and interaction in a shorter amount of development time, we will be using objects from third party APIs.</p>
        
        <p>In this regard the basic guidelines for the project are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Build something cool</li>
            <li>Create a Web-based Java application</li>
            <li>Use an API (calling it from your Java code), for example:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>FamilySearch</li>
                <li>Facebook</li>
                <li>Twitter</li>
                <li>Amazon</li>
                <li>Instagram</li>
                <li>Twilio</li>
                <li>YouTube</li>
                <li>Pinterest</li>
                <li>BigOven</li>
                <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Interact with a database (optional) - If you are only lightly using an API above, then you should also plan to have a database component. If you are using an API (or multiple APIs) extensively and it doesn't make sense to include a database in your project, you may omit this.</li>
            <li>Separate your application into three tiers (User Interface, Business Logic, Data Access)</li>
        </ul>
