        <h1>PEER REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
        <h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
        <p>As a part of your final week, each of you will evaluate the group projects of your classmates. This rating has a few purposes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Let you see the awesome things your classmates have built.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Practice critiquing others&rsquo; work in a constructive manner.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Obtain good feedback from others.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Determine our class app winners.&nbsp;This style of presentation/feedback is being done in lieu of formal class oral presentations and questions, so I hope you will take them seriously in both your own presentation and in your evaluation of others.</span></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Also, your rating will factor into the group&rsquo;s grade.</p>
        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>After Monday morning at 8:00 AM, go through each project in the class app store wiki page. You will want to spend some time on their app store page, but then also look at and play around with their web application.</p>
        <p>For each site, leave comments on the Feedback Google Doc page. You should try to point out one thing that is working well, and one suggestion for improvement.</p>
        
        <p>After going through each application, please rate the group projects on a scale of 1-5 stars.</p>
        <p><span>You should rate your own project (and only your own) as a 6.</span></p>
