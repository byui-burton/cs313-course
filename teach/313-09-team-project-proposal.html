        <h1>Java Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>Please prepare an executive summary of the group project you are proposing. Your document need not be long, but it should look professional and should clearly and concisely describe the project to be developed. Please include the following sections (each should be roughly one to two paragraphs):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Overall project description. Describe the overall application.</li>
            <li>Mockups. Include a basic page mockup for the most critical pages (not more than three, but one may be sufficient).</li>
            <li>Third party APIs. Please list any APIs that will be used for this project including what data will be gathered from these APIs and what will be posted to them. Make sure to investigate these APIs as part of planning process to verify that you will be able to do the things that you want to do.</li>
            <li>Database (if applicable). Briefly describe any database entities that will be used by your application.</li>
            <li>Milestones. Your weekly assignments for the next five weeks will be portions of your project, as follows:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Week 10: Milestone 1</li>
                <li>Week 11: Milestone 2</li>
                <li>Week 12: Milestone 3</li>
                <li>Week 13: Project Demo, App Store Submission</li>
                <li>Week 14: App Store Ratings Final</li>
            </ul>

        <p>Please indicate what portions of the project you will have done for each of the three weekly milestones. (You should list each one separately along with the progress that will be in place).</p>
        <p>In order to make sure you work through any deployment issues that may arise (they always do!), as part of your milestone #3 (Lesson 11), include "Have a version of our application working at OpenShift" along with any other goals you have for the week.</p>
    </ol>
