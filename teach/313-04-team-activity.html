        <h1>TEAM READINESS ACTIVITY</h1>
        <h3>PREPARE</h3>
        <p>Before doing this activity, each student should read the weekly preparation material to ensure that the team meeting is as efficient and effective as possible.</p>
        <h3>TEACH ONE ANOTHER</h3>
        <h5>OBJECTIVE</h5>
        <p>Design a simple relational database structure and create the schema in a MySQL database.</p>
        <h5>INSTRUCTIONS</h5>
        <p>Consider that you have been asked to write an application to store notes for users for general conference talks. The basic requirements are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>This system must track notes for multiple users.</li>
            <li>The speakers should be tracked separately from the conference because one speaker will speak at multiple conferences.</li>
            <li>Individual sessions of conference (e.g., Saturday morning, Sunday afternoon) need not be tracked, rather simply the year and month, (e.g., April 2009, Oct 2012).</li>
            <li>You need not account for the fact that some speakers will speak multiple times at a conference, but assume that a note can be tied to a &ldquo;speaker + conference.&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Multiple notes can be added by the same user about a single conference talk.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Your assignment is to create the database for this application. Please take into account good database design principles such as the elimination of redundant data, data type selection, primary keys, and foreign key relationships.</p>
        <p>The first step is to put together a design for the database (i.e., outside of your MySQL environment). You may want to use a collaborative image drawing or document editing application for this. Once you have determined the tables you will need, the data that will go into each one, and the relationships between them, you should then log into MySQL and create these tables in a test database.</p>
        <p>For this assignment, it is not required to populate these tables with data, only to implement the schema (i.e., create the tables and their relations).</p>
        <h3>PROVE</h3>
        <p>To demonstrate your tables, please list each table, show its details, and show the create statements for each. This can be accomplished with the following commands in MySQL:</p>
        <p>SHOW TABLES; (this will list all the tables in your database)</p>
        <p><b>Then for each table:</b></p>
        <p>DESCRIBE table_name; (this will list the columns for the table &ldquo;table_name&rdquo;, fill in your name here</p>
        <p>SHOW CREATE TABLE table_name; (this will show the create statement for the table &ldquo;table_name&rdquo;)</p>
        <p>After running these commands copy and paste the output into a text document and submit to I-Learn.</p>
        <p><b>Each student should submit a copy of the assignment to I-Learn.</b> Please note that these should be identical, but it is important to make sure that each student on the team has a copy of the work.</p>
